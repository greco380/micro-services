# Log Aggregator Microservice

A centralized log collection and analysis service that aggregates logs from multiple applications and provides powerful search, filtering, and monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- **Multi-source Collection**: Collect logs from files, databases, APIs, and message queues
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for immediate log analysis
- **Structured Logging**: JSON, XML, and custom format parsing
- **Search & Filter**: Elasticsearch-powered full-text search
- **Alerting**: Configurable alerts based on log patterns and thresholds
- **Dashboard**: Web-based dashboard for log visualization
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic archival and cleanup of old logs

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: Elasticsearch for log storage and search
- **Message Queue**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for log streaming
- **Processing**: Apache Spark or custom processors for log analysis
- **Storage**: S3 or similar for long-term log archival
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards

## API Endpoints

- `POST /logs` - Submit logs for processing
- `GET /logs/search` - Search logs with filters
- `GET /logs/stats` - Get log statistics and metrics
- `POST /alerts` - Configure log-based alerts
- `GET /sources` - List connected log sources
- `POST /sources` - Register new log source

## Log Sources

- **Application Logs**: Direct API integration
- **File Tailing**: Monitor log files for changes
- **Syslog**: Standard syslog protocol support
- **Database**: Query database logs and audit trails
- **Container Logs**: Docker and Kubernetes log collection
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS log streams

## Processing Features

- **Parsing**: Automatic detection and parsing of log formats
- **Enrichment**: Add metadata like geolocation, user info
- **Filtering**: Remove sensitive data and apply privacy rules
- **Aggregation**: Generate metrics and summaries from logs
- **Correlation**: Link related log entries across services
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning for unusual pattern detection

## Key Learning Objectives

- File handling and stream processing
- Data aggregation and ETL pipelines
- Full-text search implementation
- Real-time data processing
- Monitoring and alerting systems

## Implementation Notes

- Implements backpressure handling for high-volume logs
- Uses batching for efficient storage and processing
- Features configurable retention policies
- Includes data compression and deduplication
- Supports horizontal scaling across multiple instances

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Threshold Alerts**: Trigger on log volume or error rates
- **Pattern Matching**: Alert on specific log patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based unusual behavior detection
- **Integration**: Slack, email, PagerDuty, webhook notifications

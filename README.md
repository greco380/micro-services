## üèó Architecture Patterns

This project demonstrates several key architectural patterns:

- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized entry point for all services
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication via events
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation where applicable
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance and resilience
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (if running locally)
- PostgreSQL and Redis instances

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd micro-services

# Start core infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d redis postgresql

# Start individual services (example)
cd url-shortener
npm install
npm start
```

### Development Workflow
1. Choose a service to work on
2. Read the service-specific README
3. Set up the development environment
4. Implement the service following the API specification
5. Write tests and documentation
6. Integrate with other services as needed

## üìö Learning Objectives

Each service is designed to teach specific concepts:

- **Scalability**: Load balancing, caching, horizontal scaling
- **Security**: Authentication, encryption, input validation
- **Performance**: Optimization, monitoring, profiling
- **Reliability**: Error handling, retries, circuit breakers
- **Maintainability**: Clean code, documentation, testing

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **Load Tests**: Performance and scalability testing
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability and penetration testing

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

- **Logging**: Centralized logging with structured data
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics for business and technical KPIs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring and alerting

# Webhooks Listener Microservice

A reliable webhook processing service that listens for and processes incoming webhooks from external services, with support for validation, transformation, and event routing.

## Features

- **Multi-provider Support**: Handle webhooks from various external services
- **Signature Verification**: Validate webhook authenticity using signatures
- **Event Transformation**: Transform webhook payloads to internal formats
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Reliable processing with configurable retry policies
- **Event Routing**: Route events to appropriate internal services
- **Payload Validation**: Validate incoming webhook data against schemas
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate event processing and notifications

## Technical Stack

- **Web Framework**: Express.js or similar for webhook endpoints
- **Queue**: Redis Bull for reliable event processing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for webhook logs and configuration
- **Validation**: JSON Schema validation for webhook payloads
- **Security**: Signature verification and rate limiting

## API Endpoints

- `POST /webhooks/{provider}` - Receive webhooks from specific provider
- `GET /webhooks/logs` - Get webhook processing logs
- `POST /webhooks/replay/{eventId}` - Replay failed webhook event
- `GET /webhooks/stats` - Get webhook processing statistics
- `POST /webhooks/validate` - Validate webhook payload
- `GET /webhooks/providers` - List supported webhook providers

## Supported Providers

- **GitHub**: Repository events, pull requests, issues
- **Stripe**: Payment events, subscription changes
- **Slack**: Message events, user actions
- **Shopify**: Order events, product updates
- **Mailgun**: Email delivery events
- **Custom**: Generic webhook support for any service

## Event Processing

- **Immediate Processing**: Real-time event handling for critical events
- **Queued Processing**: Background processing for non-critical events
- **Batch Processing**: Group related events for efficient processing
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate event processing
- **Event Ordering**: Maintain event order when required
- **Conditional Processing**: Process events based on conditions

## Security Features

- **Signature Verification**: HMAC signature validation
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict webhooks to known IP addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent webhook flooding and abuse
- **Payload Size Limits**: Protect against oversized payloads
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure webhook transmission
- **Authentication**: Optional authentication for webhook endpoints

## Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle permanently failed events
- **Error Notifications**: Alert on processing failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing other events on failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Monitoring**: Track error rates and processing health

## Event Transformation

- **Payload Mapping**: Transform external formats to internal schemas
- **Data Enrichment**: Add additional context to webhook events
- **Field Extraction**: Extract relevant data from complex payloads
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between different data formats
- **Validation**: Ensure transformed data meets requirements
- **Custom Transformers**: Pluggable transformation logic

## Key Learning Objectives

- Webhook protocol implementation and best practices
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Reliable message processing and queuing

- Uses database transactions for reliable event storage
- Features comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
- Includes health checks and monitoring endpoints
- Supports horizontal scaling for high-volume webhooks

## Monitoring & Analytics

- **Processing Metrics**: Track webhook volume and processing times
- **Error Tracking**: Monitor failed webhooks and error patterns
- **Provider Analytics**: Analyze webhook patterns by provider
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance under load
- **Alerting**: Configurable alerts for processing issues

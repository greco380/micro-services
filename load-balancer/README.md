# Load Balancer Microservice

An intelligent load balancer that optimizes request distribution across service instances with advanced batch processing capabilities and performance monitoring for enhanced computation and request speed.

## Features

- **Smart Load Distribution**: Multiple algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted)
- **Batch Processing Optimization**: Intelligently separates batch tasks for parallel execution
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and automatic failover
- **Request Routing**: Content-based routing and sticky sessions
- **Auto-scaling Integration**: Dynamically spin up/down service instances
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed metrics on response times and throughput
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures with intelligent circuit breaking

## Technical Stack

- **Proxy**: NGINX or HAProxy for high-performance load balancing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for configuration and metrics storage
- **Cache**: Redis for session stickiness and performance data
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection
- **Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for batch job distribution

## API Endpoints

- `POST /register` - Register a new service instance
- `DELETE /unregister/{instanceId}` - Remove service instance
- `GET /health` - Get health status of all instances
- `GET /metrics` - Get load balancing metrics and statistics
- `POST /batch/optimize` - Optimize batch job distribution
- `GET /instances` - List all registered service instances

## Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly across instances
- **Least Connections**: Route to instance with fewest active connections
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Distribute based on instance capacity weights
- **IP Hash**: Consistent routing based on client IP
- **Least Response Time**: Route to fastest responding instance
- **Custom**: Pluggable custom algorithms

## Batch Processing Optimization

- **Task Analysis**: Analyze batch jobs to determine optimal splitting strategies
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocate instances based on task requirements
- **Parallel Execution**: Distribute batch tasks across multiple instances
- **Load Prediction**: Predict optimal number of instances for given workload
- **Queue Management**: Intelligent queuing for batch processing tasks
- **Performance Tuning**: Automatic adjustment based on execution metrics

## Health Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: HTTP, TCP, and custom health check protocols
- **Failure Detection**: Rapid detection of instance failures
- **Auto-recovery**: Automatic re-routing when instances recover
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, error rate, and throughput tracking
- **Alerting**: Configurable alerts for performance degradation
